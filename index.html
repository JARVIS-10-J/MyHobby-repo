            <h3>Football history</h3>
            <p>
                Football also known as soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world which arose in England around the 19th century. Football is a team sport which is played by placing the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. Each team is made up of 11 players so making 22 players with a referee on the pitch.

            <h3>About my hobby</h3>
            <p>
                Football is my favourite hobby and I play on the weekends usually in the morning. It is normally played by four teams for 45 minutes and if there is a tie the referee tosses a coin between the two teams to get one out for another team to play.
I usually love to play as an attacker or forward because of my strengths which are acceleration, pace, speed and dribbling. Additionally, scoring a goal is one of the best feeling as a football player but it is not an easy task to do. Personally I play football for both training and fun purposes which is something that has so many implications on my physical and mental health. My football idol has always been Lionel Messi since I started to play the game because of his ability to dibble, pass and score a lot of goals.
